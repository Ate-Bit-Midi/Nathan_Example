- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing Git

**If you are using Visual Studio Community Edition, you can skip this step.**
> git is built into the program and can be accessed via the `Developer Powershell` (`Tools > Command Line > Developer Powershell`).

Otherwise, you will most likely need to [download and install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Download for your operating system and follow the instructions the installer gives you.

Now, you should have git accessible from some terminal in your computer, either in Visual Studio or otherwise.
